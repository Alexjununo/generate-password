### Running on native machine
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Set the environment variables in `.env` file
3. Run the application in development mode with `npm run dev`
4. Access `https://localhost:3000` and you're ready to go!

- `start` Run the application in production mode (prefer not to do that in development)
- `lint`: Lint the codebase
- `lint-fix`: Lint the codebase and fix the issues
